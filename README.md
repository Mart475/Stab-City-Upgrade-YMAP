**[Release] [YMAP] Stab City Upgrade.**

Stab City Upgrade is a small upgrade of the Stab City area which adds about 15+ new props to the area. It was created in Codewalker, with each prop being hand placed and moved into it's correct position. I could go on for hours of how asthetically pleasing this YMAP is, I really like my creation.
