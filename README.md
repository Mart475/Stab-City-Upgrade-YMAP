**[Release] [YMAP] Stab City Upgrade.**

---

The Stab City Upgrade is a small upgrade of the Stab City area which adds about 15+ new props to the area. It was created in Codewalker with each prop being placed by hand, and then nicely plopped into position. I could go on for hours of how aesthetically pleasing this YMAP is, I really like my creation.
